# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```dot
digraph verify_gate {
    rankdir=TD;
    node [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#f9f9f9"];
    
    start [label="About to claim success\nor completion?", shape=oval, fillcolor="#ffdce0"];
    identify [label="1. IDENTIFY command\nthat proves it"];
    run [label="2. RUN full command\n(fresh)"];
    read [label="3. READ full output\n(exit codes, failures)", shape=diamond, fillcolor="#fff3cd"];
    success [label="Output confirms claim?"];
    state_actual [label="State ACTUAL status\nwith failure evidence", fillcolor="#f8d7da"];
    state_claim [label="State claim WITH\nsuccess evidence", fillcolor="#d4edda"];
    
    start -> identify;
    identify -> run;
    run -> read;
    read -> success [label="Analyzed"];
    success -> state_actual [label="No (Failed)"];
    success -> state_claim [label="Yes (Passed)"];
    
    state_actual -> identify [label="Fix & Retry", color="red"];
}
```

**Skip any step = lying, not verifying**

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**

```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**

```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**

```
✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**

```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**

```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## Why This Matters

From 24 failure memories:

- your human partner said "I don't believe you" - trust broken
- Undefined functions shipped - would crash
- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features
- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework
- Violates: "Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced."

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**

- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents

**Rule applies to:**

- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

## The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.**

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.

## 中文执行层

### 触发条件
- Use when you are about to say "it works", "I fixed it", "tests pass", when you are about to commit code, or when you are about to tell the human partner that a task is complete.

### 前置条件
- 已确认当前任务与本 skill 的适用范围匹配。
- 已读取本文件的关键步骤，并确认命令路径基于仓库真实文件。
- 若依赖外部工具或凭据，先执行最小可用性检查（如 --help 或版本检查）。

### 执行步骤
1. 先按本 skill 的流程章节确认边界和产出物。
2. 先执行最小可验证步骤，再逐步扩展到完整实现。
3. 过程中的关键命令、输入和结果要记录到可复盘证据中。
4. 若与 AGENTS.md 路由冲突，以项目级约定和任务目标为准。

### 完成证据
- 提供关键命令与输出摘要，必要时附日志或报告文件路径。
- 列出受影响文件和核心改动点，确保与需求一一对应。
- 明确说明验证是否通过，以及尚未覆盖的风险。

### 失败回退
- 失败时先保留现场与报错信息，再定位根因并重试。
- 如需降级方案，必须说明影响范围、回退路径和补偿措施。
